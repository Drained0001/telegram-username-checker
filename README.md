# Telegram Username Checker

In order to use this tool you need have up to date versions of python and pip installed first. This uses telethon to interact with the telegram api and allows you to check usernames, however you need to obtain an api `id` and `hash` to use this checker. `setup.bat` can be used to install the imports for the checker on windows or you can type `pip install configparser telethon` into your cmd to install them manually. Once installed open up a command prompt, cd to the file path and run `python check.py` you will first be prompted with a login (telephone) and then code sent to your telegram account. Once logged in a session file is created and you will be able to run the checker.

I do not condone breaking TOS of the Telegram api with this tool.
